This is my in-development third year project entitled "Integrating the Butterfly Effect into Interactive Game Worlds"

Abstract:

Video games create immersion unmatched by other forms of media. There are many rich and complex worlds that pull players into the experience. However, while many modern games aim to offer players meaningful choices, these are often limited by hard-coded options that produce specific, predetermined outcomes. This limits the player’s ability to shape the world they inhabit in nuanced ways. 
This project explores integrating the "butterfly effect" into game world design to create a system where even minor actions can have evolving and far-reaching consequences. Stealing from a non-player character (NPC) increments the player‘s money but what does this do to the NPC afterwards? All actions have consequences, the player can see this and feel a part of the world, without it being explicitly scripted. 
A prototype game of a small settlement will demonstrate this system in action, allowing players to interact with the world and observe how their decisions ripple outward. By allowing consequences to emerge organically, this project seeks to deepen immersion and make game worlds feel truly responsive and alive.
